### Tell us a little about what you do
They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. My mom is an artist and my dad is an engineer; I was raised in a home filled with art, literature and salvaged mission control parts from my dad's work at NASA, so naturally I became a media artist.

For most of my life I've been obsessed with painting in light. I portray our world by capturing it in pixels and transform it to steal glimpses behind the veil. To paraphrase Frank Zappa, my job as a media artist is to decorate fragments of spacetime. I work solo and in collaboration with musicians, writers, performing and visual artists.


### Which tech trend(s) are getting the most of your attention right now?
I'm currently obsessed with WebGL, Eurorack Modular Synths and Thermal Photography. 


### Which industry or art trends are getting the most of your attention right now?
I believe a symbiotic union of cryptocurrencies and media art will make these media less ethereal and ephemeral. I've been working with ConsenSys to record art sales and provenance within the Ethereum blockchain, starting with my WebGL moving painting series http://www.justasec.XYZ 
 

### Which hardware (or software, product, platform) are you excited about the potential of, and why?
I'd like to build a research lab to develop photogrammetry as a realtime process in order to make video portraits in four dimensions.

 
### Which blogs or zines do you peruse right now?
I spend most of my time on technology user forums and hunting down beautiful media art.

 
### Any other thoughts?
Come to Hacklab, let's build tools for making art.

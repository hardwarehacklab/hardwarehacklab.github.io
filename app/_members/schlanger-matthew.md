##Tell us a little about what you do
I write code, design games, and make video, not necessarily in that order.

I also build [audio and video synthesizers](http://matthewschlanger.com/blog/modular-video-synth) and shoot 3D photos. Most of my time these days I spend managing a team building a new social media network about learning. Imagine social media that's about recording and sharing your life long and daily learning. This is called L2O. If you want to be a beta tester let me know. One great thing about this work is that it keeps me focused on learning, and creating a place where we can share learning.

When I can get away from work I try to turn on the tools in my studio. I have an old school analog video lab comprised mostly of custom audio and video synthesizers along with tools I’ve collected. Turning it all on seems to be the hard part.

##Which tech trend(s) are getting the most of your attention right now?
On the programming side I am looking into AngularJS and ReactJS. I want to find the time to also learn Swift and Python, but all things JS are the typically the top of my list these days. I want to get back to exploring ThreeJS. And I have some AS3 work to catch up on, kicking it old school is still a great path for game app development.

This year I had the opportunity to do a [side project for the MTA](http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150529/upper-east-side/video-mta-simulator-lets-you-drive-second-avenue-subway) that involved controlling a hardware interface with an Arduino, I would like to find the time to do more with the Arduino, and find time for a Rasberry Pi project.

##Which industry or art trends are getting the most of your attention right now?
At work I am thinking about lean development practices and tools for measuring user interaction to create validated learning. [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/learn/segmentation) is the measure piece in the "Build, Measure, Learn" feedback loop.

I was getting interested in data visualization and [the work Tableau was doing](http://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi) - go to the gallery.

I try to stay away from the art trends but it's good to see the resurgence of analog. I have begun collecting Eurorack modules. There is not much reason to keep building audio synths when there is so much one can buy instead. I am working on a small audio synth that I want to finish, then likely I will never build and audio synth module ever again.

##Which hardware (or software, product, platform) are you excited about the potential of, and why?
[David Jones](http://www.jonesvideo.com/) is designing an array of video synthesis module prototypes. They are an interesting mix of old and new school.
 
##Which blogs or zines do you peruse right now?
The New Yorker and the New York Times are still my mainstays. Then Wired and whatever I see that pulls me in.

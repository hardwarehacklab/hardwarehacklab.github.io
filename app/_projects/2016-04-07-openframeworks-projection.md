##Tell us a little about what you do

I'm an artist, designer and creative coder. I usually make [video pipelines](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC64gD1NN-GE_tfd0swtxcOA) and [unidentified web objects](http://lovemachine.cc/). 
I basically like anything that involves mashups and that can be manipulated with code.

Apart from some binary blobs here and there, my toolbox is composed only of free/libre open source software. 
This is necessary for my work as it corresponds to the ethics and philosophy I enjoy in the digital world as much as it gives me the freedom to do whatever I want with those tools. 
So it's both a way to see life, authorship and collaboration as it is a practical way to build things.
 
Lately I've been studying ways to improve [collaboration between graphic designers](http://p.xuv.be/collaborative-tools-for-designers-part-1) and plan to turn the many ideas I have around this into a usable tool.
I also collect [laptops covered with stickers](https://instagram.com/xuvgram/), references of [abuse and empathy with robots](http://slapmybot.tumblr.com/) and run my own [NYCmesh](http://nycmesh.net) node.
 

##Which tech trend(s) are getting the most of your attention right now?

I've always been interested in distributed technologies... from file sharing to messaging and nowadays digital "currencies".  
It's {how|why} internet was built and although it looks like a dying idea sometimes, there always new stuff popping up.

So I keep a eye on:

- <https://www.ethereum.org/>
- <http://matrix.org/>
- <http://cozy.io/>


##Which blogs or zines do you peruse right now?

I have an [RSS reader](https://tt-rss.org/gitlab/fox/tt-rss) with ~200 feeds.
But my latest favorites are:

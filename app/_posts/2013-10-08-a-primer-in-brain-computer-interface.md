<p>When Conor from <a href="http://openbci.com">OpenBCI</a> dropped by the hack lab, we accosted him. Here he is explaining the basics of Brain-Computer Interface.</p>

<p>You'll get a quick, hands-on explanation of how BCI works, who is doing it, and why the OpenBCI product is unique.</p>

<p>This is one of the things that makes hack lab such a great space - you can approach tech conversationally. We actually met OpenBCI through a mutual friend at Parsons, where Conor and Joel teach.</p>

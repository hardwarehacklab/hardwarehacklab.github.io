<p>When we found out that Neil Harbisson and Moon Ribas were in town we jumped at the chance to have them come visit us the hack lab.</p>

<p>In case you haven't heard, these two are living with extra senses:</p>

<p>Neil has an antenna implanted in his skull which allows him to hear color. Moon has a vibrating implant in her elbow which is wirelessly connected to online seismographs, which means she can sense earthquakes from all over the world.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>Together they run the non-profit <a href="http://cyborgism.wix.com/cyborg">Cyborg Foundation</a>, with a stated mission to:</p>

<blockquote><p>"help humans become cyborgs, to promote the use of cybernetics as part of the human body and to defend cyborg rights"</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most surprising things about meeting these two is how fun they are. Something about the word cyborg conjures up a very serious feeling, but in reality their presentation is full of jokes.</p>

<p>It's also tempting to think they are a little ahead of their time - but are they really? <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140924-the-greatest-myths-about-cyborgs">Human augmentation</a> has a long history. The difference with Neil and Moon is that their implants were not born out of necessity. They <em>augment</em> senses in a way distinct from <em>replacing</em> or <em>improving</em> senses.</p>

<p>At the same time, they are using particular language to talk about themselves. They are 'cyborgs'. They have permanent, non-removable implants. They are thinking of these augmentations as modifications of the idea of being human at all.</p>

<p>Defending the right to <em>choose</em> to be transhuman - it seems that is where they really are treading new ground.</p>

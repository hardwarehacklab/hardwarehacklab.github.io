<p>Mayank flew all the way from Delhi, and decided to spend a night with us. That's about 7,000 miles! He plugged in the Myo to his laptop and started programming an Arduino-mounted LED to respond to human gestures.</p>

<p>Around that we had another killer night. In the room we had a food-printing entrepreneur, a virtual-reality analytics hacker, a crypto-currency IoT evangelist and a professional chess player. That's a weird and wonderful mix.</p>

<p>We had lots of beginners too, as always. People come here because we make a relaxed atmosphere for people of all backgrounds. Some are 20-year veterans, some are checking out tech for the first time and just curious.</p>

<p>One group last night had never played with hardware before. They pulled some of our stock Arduinos from the shelf and started trying out the demos in the books.</p>

<p>We also had an industrial designer who had a 3D-printed headmount product but had decided she wanted to learn 3D programming with Unity. We teamed her up with a couple of Oculus enthusiasts.</p>

<p>You know something really special is going on, when every Wednesday you get a mix like this. The industry generally is boiling over with creativity, and so is our hack lab.</p>

title     : "Projection Mapping with CHiKA"

<p>Installation artist CHiKA paid a visit to the lab yesterday. She gave an introduction to projection mapping, the technique for projecting video patterns to match the contours of real-world objects.</p>

<p>This is a technique CHiKA often uses in her artworks. The method she uses is based on combining the powers of two different software packages, along with a projector and a laptop.</p>

<!--excerpt-ends-->

<p>The first software is <a href="http://www.modul8.ch/">Modul8</a>, a VJing and video-mixing package. The second is <a href="http://www.madmapper.com/">MadMapper</a>, a tool which allows you to define how the video from Modul8 will match the contours of real-world objects.</p>

<p>To learn more, you could attend one of CHiKA's <a href="http://www.mappathon.com/">Mappathons</a>. They are a bit like hackathons but for projection mapping - an intensive learning and creative experience, with a built-in exhibition opportunity.</p>

<p>We took a look at <a href="http://imagima.com">CHiKA's portfolio</a> for inspiration, and checked out video of recent interactive work. In one work CHiKA uses leap motion to control long LED strips and Japan-inspired sound effects - check out the video to get a sense of her ouvre.</p>

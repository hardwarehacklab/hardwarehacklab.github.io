<p>Looking Glass are a cool startup making 3D displays. They dropped by the lab last night to show us the products they've been developing.</p>

<p>Most impressive were the new volumetric display prototypes. Prototype 3D cubes, which they plan to mass manufacture and sell online - appropriately named 'L3D Cube'.</p>

<p>These guys are hackers at heart and brought in some cool demos to show off. One of them involves holding a plastic painting palette. On the palette are bits of colored play-doh hooked up to a Makey-Makey and a Leap Motion.</p>

<p>When you press your finger on the play-doh you can switch colors, and as you wave your hand above the Leap you move a cursor in 3D space. In this way you have direct control over the contents of the L3D Cube.</p>

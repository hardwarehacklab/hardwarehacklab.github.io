Something about the word cyborg conjures up a very serious feeling, but in reality their presentation is full of jokes.</p><p>It's also tempting to think they are a little ahead of their time - but are they really? <a href=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140924-the-greatest-myths-about-cyborgs>Human augmentation</a> has a long history. The difference with Neil and Moon is that their implants were not born out of necessity. They <em>augment</em> senses in a way distinct from <em>replacing</em> or <em>improving</em> senses.</p><p>At the same time, they are using particular language to talk about themselves. They are 'cyborgs'. They have permanent, non-removable implants. They are thinking of these augmentations as modifications of the idea of being human at all.</p><p>Defending the right to <em>choose</em> to be transhuman - it seems that is where they really are treading new ground.</p><hr></article><ul id=paging class=cta><li><a href="/stories/kinect-projector-toolkit/">Previous post</a></li><li><a href="/stories/volumetric-imaging-with-looking-glass/">Next post</a></li></ul></main><script src=/javascript/script.02d8.js></script></body></html>

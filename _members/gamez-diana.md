## Tell us a little about what you do
I code, build robots and make them smarter using artificial intelligence. I am currently developing a robot that can help my grandpa. I am a food and tech lover so I am happier when I combine them together.

## Which tech trend(s) are getting the most of your attention right now?
I am interested on artificial intelligence and cognitive sciences. Specially on:
- Image recognition
- Automated reasoning
- Robots
- AI for health care
- Data science

## Which hardware (or software, product, platform) are you excited about the potential of, and why?
So far, I am surprised by the power of AWS and Google Colab with data science and artificial intelligence.

I am working at the moment with raspberry pi and open source software that have been surprising me so far.

## Which blogs or zines do you peruse right now?

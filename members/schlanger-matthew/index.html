Most of my time these days I spend managing a team building a new social media network about learning. Imagine social media that’s about recording and sharing your life long and daily learning. This is called L2O. If you want to be a beta tester let me know. One great thing about this work is that it keeps me focused on learning, and creating a place where we can share learning.</p><div class=video><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/18288701?color=ffffff" frameborder=0 webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>When I can get away from work I try to turn on the tools in my studio. I have an old school analog video lab comprised mostly of custom audio and video synthesizers along with tools I’ve collected. Turning it all on seems to be the hard part.</p><h2 id=which-tech-trends-are-getting-the-most-of-your-attention-right-now>Which tech trend(s) are getting the most of your attention right now?</h2><p>On the programming side I am looking into AngularJS and ReactJS. I want to find the time to also learn Swift and Python, but all things JS are the typically the top of my list these days. I want to get back to exploring ThreeJS. And I have some AS3 work to catch up on, kicking it old school is still a great path for game app development.</p><p>This year I had the opportunity to do a <a href=http://www.dnainfo.com/new-york/20150529/upper-east-side/video-mta-simulator-lets-you-drive-second-avenue-subway>side project for the MTA</a> that involved controlling a hardware interface with an Arduino, I would like to find the time to do more with the Arduino, and find time for a Rasberry Pi project.</p><h2 id=which-industry-or-art-trends-are-getting-the-most-of-your-attention-right-now>Which industry or art trends are getting the most of your attention right now?</h2><p>At work I am thinking about lean development practices and tools for measuring user interaction to create validated learning. <a href=https://mixpanel.com/learn/segmentation>Mixpanel</a> is the measure piece in the “Build, Measure, Learn” feedback loop.</p><p>I was getting interested in data visualization and <a href=http://www.tableau.com/products/cloud-bi>the work Tableau was doing</a> - go to the gallery.</p><p>I try to stay away from the art trends but it’s good to see the resurgence of analog. I have begun collecting Eurorack modules. There is not much reason to keep building audio synths when there is so much one can buy instead. I am working on a small audio synth that I want to finish, then likely I will never build and audio synth module ever again.</p><h2 id=which-hardware-or-software-product-platform-are-you-excited-about-the-potential-of-and-why>Which hardware (or software, product, platform) are you excited about the potential of, and why?</h2><p><a href="http://www.jonesvideo.com/">David Jones</a> is designing an array of video synthesis module prototypes.
